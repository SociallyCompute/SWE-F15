Once upon a time


There was a wizard who wanted to 


Climb mount kilimanjaro and 


kill the kraken lurking in the ocean



He wanted to battle with a Samari 


On his way he met the Beast of Gevaudan


He was soon set upon by reptoids!


and using what was taught to him by the hairy dwarfs of Atlantis


he managed to levitate to safety.


He decided he had earned 18 big macs.


 He decided that he was only going to eat half of the big macs and give the other half to his ninja friend.



But then the ninjas showed up 


as we sat by the gardens and down by the trees, on which sky serpents sat in the gentle, cool breeze. 


Eating a chocolate eclaire and drinking irish coffee.


Luckily, pollution in the cloud killed him.


Then the brave wizard pulled out his wand.



His only choice was to Nae Nae 



He was unable to escape, the King Cheetah was too fast.


That's what Linus Torvald taught me 


a long long long long long time ago,


on our trip to Prague, where we



Witches are just meant to be magical beings 


had ended up electrocuting the village 


He saw the talking Shamanu


Bigfoot taught him in the ways of the ninja.


and took a selfie with it



And that's why you don't give a wizard a toaster 



Wizards can't use toasters 


While singing Renegade by Styx.


They like to go bowling with the Chupacabra.



Who doesnt like to go bowling Warlocks?



Not even a visit from THE CLOUD can heal a wounded unicorn.


From the Gamehendge tale, a book filled with everything the Lizards needed to know to live their lives in peace & harmony, all of the knowledge inherent in the universe.
Wilson steals it from the Lizards and hides it away in his castle.


 But we couldn't stay happy like that forever, and soon our dreams to grow old together were dashed on the rocks. 



He was slowly losing touch with reality 


To this day the villagers will not go near this place



The end.
