Once upon a time


There was a wizard who wanted to 


Climb mount kilimanjaro and 


kill the kraken lurking in the ocean


who ate the Passenger Pigeon


He wanted to battle with a Samari 


On his way he met the Beast of Gevaudan



The Wizard was convinced he could take John Cena. 


who demanded that he provide him with a shrubbery.


He was soon set upon by reptoids!


and using what was taught to him by the hairy dwarfs of Atlantis



Then there was mass amounts of confusion when the molerat showed up!


he managed to levitate to safety.


He decided he had earned 18 big macs.


 The wizard decided that he was only going to eat half of the big macs and give the other half to his ninja friend.


His ninja friend was named Big Tony and preferred canolis to Big Macs, but wasn't one to say no to free food.



But then the ninjas showed up 




as we sat by the gardens and down by the trees, on which sky serpents sat in the gentle, cool breeze. 


Eating a chocolate eclaire and drinking irish coffee.


Luckily, pollution in the cloud killed him.


Then the brave wizard pulled out his wand.



Won the lottery and went to Disneyland. 

And dropped the hottest mixtape of 2015! 


His only choice was to Nae Nae 



The Wizard was furious!


because no one ever taught him how to dougie.



He was unable to escape, the King Cheetah was too fast.

Then Trinity killed Dumbledore with rosebud.


Luckily Chester gave me the magic Cheeto dust!


To find out it was broken But indeed the wizard had another one.



That's what Linus Torvald taught me 


a long long long long long time ago,


on our trip to Prague, where we


drank lots of...eLiXeR

frolicked through fields of posies, holding hands and laughing.



Witches are just meant to be magical beings 


had ended up electrocuting the village 


He saw the talking Shamanu


Bigfoot taught him in the ways of the ninja.


and took a selfie with it



And that's why you don't give a wizard a toaster 



Why?



Wizards can't use toasters 


Because toasters ain't loyal!

While singing Renegade by Styx.



Everything seemed to calm down after the calamity.


They like to go bowling with the Chupacabra.



Who doesnt like to go bowling Chupacabra?



Not even a visit from THE CLOUD can heal a wounded unicorn.

As the metaphorical storm grew all the realm huddled together in fear.

Except for one man that is, and his name was JOHHHHHHNNNN CEEEENNNNAAAA



From the Gamehendge tale, a book filled with everything the Lizards needed to know to live their lives in peace & harmony, all of the knowledge inherent in the universe.
Wilson steals it from the Lizards and hides it away in his castle.
Col. Forbin retrives it, with the help of the famous Mockingbird, but then uses it for his own power.


 But we couldn't stay happy like that forever, and soon our dreams to grow old together were dashed on the rocks. 



He was slowly losing touch with reality 


To this day the villagers will not go near this place



But one day, a little villager named Dante dared to do what no one had ever dared before...  Some say what he did was "opossom"-able.



Didn't have any weapons to slay the dragon. 


It had then dawned on him the staggering realization that he had left the stove on!


Driven mad by everyone else's use of two space indentation instead of four space, he summoned Beelzebub.

Never had I seen that many cooks in one place


Since their ultimate goal is to discover



The end.
