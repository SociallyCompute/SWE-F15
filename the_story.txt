Once upon a time


There was a wizard who wanted to 


Climb mount kilimanjaro and 


kill the kraken lurking in the ocean



He wanted to battle with a Samari 


On his way he met the Beast of Gevaudan


He was soon set upon by reptoids!


and using what was taught to him by the hairy dwarfs of Atlantis


he managed to levitate to safety.


He decided he had earned 18 big macs.


But then the ninjas showed up 


Eating a chocolate eclaire and drinking irish coffee.


Then the view of the cloud was slowly blocked out by the approaching gargantuan Mothman.


Luckily, pollution in the cloud killed him.



That's what Linus Torvald taught me 


a long long long long long time ago,


on our trip to Prague, where we



Witches are just meant to be magical beings 


had ended up electrocuting the village 


He saw the talking Shamanu


Bigfoot taught him in the ways of the ninja.


and took a selfie with it



And that's why you don't give a wizard a toaster 



Wizards can't use toasters 


While singing Renegade by Styx.


Warlocks are actually nice people if you get to know them!


They like to go bowling with the Chupacabra.



The end.
